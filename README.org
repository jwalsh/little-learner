* How do I work with the code examples?

1. Install Racket by following instructions in the book Appendix
   - Use the =Makefile= or setup script to get required packages
2. Look at the chapter file naming convention 
   - Files named like =ch01-lines-sleep-p018.rkt=
3. Open files in DrRacket to work with examples
   - Load =malt= package in files
4. Follow the book structure and annotate code with your own notes
5. Run examples like convolutional networks on supplied datasets
6. Use supplied scripts to test and update code
